I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in computer vision and robotics in agricultural settings at the Photogrammetry Lab at the University of Bonn.

I developed my passion for the field as a young tinkerer, thanks to Arduino, which enabled me to delve into the world of small robots early on.

This led me wanting to deepen my theorical knowledge so I moved to Germany for to do a B.Eng. in Automation and Robotics. Here I learned the foundations of Informatics, Electronics and Mechanics, and aquired computer vision skills during my B.Eng. thesis on object detection and tracking in images. While studying I worked for Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation, where I tackled problems about localization, mapping and navigation for service robots.

Due to deep learning becoming the most promising approach for computer vision in those years I decided to pursue my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at “La Sapienza” University Rome, Italy. There I deepened my knowledge of computer vision methods and robotics skills, leading to a thesis on Perception and path planning for Mobile Robots.

During my masters my interest for neural based vision increased due to the rapid growth of the field. I was eagear to learn more about the recent advancements in the field and discover the academic environment. Therefore, I started my PhD at the University of Bonn, focusing on 3D reconstruction methods applied to agriculture.
