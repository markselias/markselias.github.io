I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Vision and Robotics at the Photogrammetry and Robotics Lab of the University of Bonn, where I explore how 3D reconstruction can help us better understand and automate agricultural environments.

My passion for robotics began early on with Arduino projects that sparked my fascination for developing autonomous systems.
To build a strong foundation, I pursued a B.Eng. in Automation and Robotics in Germany, gaining hands-on experience in informatics, electronics, and mechanics with a thesis on object detection and tracking. Alongside the Bachelor I also worked at the Fraunhofer Institute, tackling localization and navigation challenges for service robots.

As deep learning began transforming computer vision, I wanted to dive deeper into the field. I moved to Rome for a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at La Sapienza University, where I deepened my knowledge of computer vision methods and robotics skills, leading to a thesis on Perception and path planning for Mobile Robots.

Over time, I became increasingly fascinated by how neural networks can interpret and reconstruct the 3D world. That curiosity brought me to Bonn, where my Ph.D. now combines my love for robotics, AI, and the outdoors, applying cutting-edge vision techniques to real-world problems in agriculture.
