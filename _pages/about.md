I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Vision and Robotics at the Photogrammetry and Robotics Lab of the University of Bonn, where I develop 3D perception and reconstruction methods to help us understand and automate complex real-world environments such as agricultural environments.

My work bridges research and application by designing novel algorithms that transform multi-sensor data into 3D representations that can be leveraged to solve real-world problems autonomously. This includes experience with both deep learning and traditional methods for 3D vision, multi-view geometry, and large-scale field data collection and calibration.

My passion for robotics started with early Arduino projects and grew through a B.Eng. in Automation and Robotics in Germany, where I explored object detection and tracking and worked at Fraunhofer on localization and navigation for service robots. Later, during my M.Sc. in AI and Robotics in Rome, I deepened my expertise in computer vision and motion planning, completing a thesis on perception and path planning for mobile robots.

My research has been recognized with multiple Best Paper Awards at leading robotics and perception venues, including ICRA, IROS, and RA-L.

Passionate about developing new ideas to solve concrete problems, I aim to apply my expertise in 3D computer vision, perception, and neural reconstruction to build intelligent, real-world systems.
